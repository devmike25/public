Key to a facility of this style and magnitude are the supporting items required to maintain safe and productive working habits. These items will constitute a large range of categories, and the WPCA is actively seeking expressions of interests from suppliers interested in being evaluated for inclusion on a Workshop ICT Procurement Panel for the AMRF.\nThe attached Invitation To Respond (ITR) documents describe the services required and set out the conditions of tendering. The ITR will remain open for submissions for the duration of the contract until 30 June 2026. Any submissions received will be evaluated every quarter starting July 2024, September 2024, December 2024 then March 2025, June 2025, September 2025, December 2025 and March 2026, June 2026. To be included in the first batch of evaluations, your proposal must be lodged prior to Wednesday 31st July 2024 at 5:00pm AEST. \nYou should note that Western Parkland City Authority may issue an addendum to the invitation documents prior to the close of the ITR.\nIt is your firm s responsibility to ensure that it submits and lodges a compliant ITR response. Should you require any clarification on any aspect of the invitation documents or tender process, you should contact Western Parkland City Authority Procurement at amrfpanels@wpca.sydney We are unable due to issues of probity to discuss these issues with you verbally.\nConfidentiality: You should note that any individual(s) proposed as a resource in you firm s proposal must complete and sign the Confidentiality Deed Poll (provided as a Word document) and this duly executed document must be lodged as part of your submission.\nCode of Ethics and Conduct: A copy of the Authority s Code of Ethics and Conduct for Procurement activities is included as part of the ITR documents. It is a contractual responsibility placed on all Suppliers to provide a copy of this document to any individual engaged in delivering the Services. A central issue in the Authority s code of conduct is the mitigation of any actual, perceived, or potential conflict of interests which may arise when a person engaged in delivering the Services is confronted with issues that that cause a conflict between that person s public duties and their personal or private interests. It is incumbent upon any individual engaged on any Western Parkland City Authority contract to disclose to the Authority any conflicts of interest as soon as practicable after the situation reasonably comes to their attention. Any and all such conflicts of interests must be advised to Western Parkland City Authority (amrfpanels@wpca.sydney)\nWestern Parkland City Authority looks forward to reviewing your firm s proposal.\nAn online briefing will be held via MS Teams on the week starting 15th July 2024. Please email the amrfpanels@wpca.sydney email address with your Company Name, Contact Person, Contact Email Address before Tuesday 9th July 2024 and we will send you a link to the briefing.]]></description>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[RAA Loan Solution]]></title>\n            <link>https://www.tenders.nsw.gov.au/wsroc/?event=public.rft.show&amp;RFTUUID=D0D314B9-9F65-22C5-E310ED31C6A4B6DB</link>\n            <guid>https://www.tenders.nsw.gov.au/wsroc/?event=public.rft.show&amp;RFTUUID=D0D314B9-9F65-22C5-E310ED31C6A4B6DB</guid>\n            <pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[The Rural Assistance Authority (RAA) is issuing a Request for Tender (RFT) for the procurement and implementation of an off-the-shelf Loan Management Solution.
